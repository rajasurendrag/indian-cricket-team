          Kapil Dev’s iconic running catch to dismiss Viv Richards turned the
          match in India’s favor </strong
        >, and Amarnath’s all-round brilliance earned him the Man of the Match
        award. With a stunning 43-run victory,
        <strong> India lifted their first-ever World Cup </strong>, shocking the
        cricketing world and inspiring future generations. This triumph was more
        than just a win; it ignited India’s passion for cricket, transformed the

        the global stage.<strong>
